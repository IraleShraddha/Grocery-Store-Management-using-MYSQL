# 🛒 Grocery Store Management System (SQL Project)

A relational database project designed to efficiently manage operations of a grocery store using **MySQL**. This system manages products, suppliers, customers, employees, and order details while enabling insightful data analysis through advanced SQL queries.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world grocery store scenario by implementing normalized tables and executing advanced SQL queries to analyze business performance and maintain operational integrity.

## 🧱 Database Structure

The database contains the following tables:

- `supplier` – Stores supplier details.
- `categories` – Contains product category names.
- `employees` – Records employee information.
- `customers` – Holds customer details.
- `products` – Product catalog with supplier and category references.
- `orders` – Customer orders with employee tracking.
- `order_details` – Product-level details for each order.

All tables are connected using **primary** and **foreign key constraints** to ensure data integrity and normalization.

## 🛠️ Features & SQL Concepts Used

- ✅ **Database Design & Normalization**
- ✅ **Primary and Foreign Key Constraints**
- ✅ **JOINS** (INNER, LEFT, FULL OUTER via UNION)
- ✅ **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- ✅ **GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY**
- ✅ **Subqueries (Correlated & Nested)**
- ✅ **Date-based Filtering and WEEK() Function**
- ✅ **Data Manipulation** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- ✅ **Views & Triggers** (if implemented)

## 🔍 Sample Business Insights

- Top customers based on purchase value
- Best-selling products by quantity
- Average order value per employee
- Revenue trends using order dates
- Price variation across products and orders

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Strong understanding of relational database concepts
- Practical experience with real-world SQL query writing
- Analytical thinking through query-based insights
- Mastery of data relationships, joins, and optimization
